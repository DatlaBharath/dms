        <h1 className='text-[30px] text-primary font-semibold'>Vision</h1>
        <p className='font-mono text-justify'>
            Our vision is to create a world where every child has the opportunity to pursue their 
            education, regardless of their financial circumstances. We envision a society where the 
            absence of financial resources does not hinder a child's access to knowledge, growth, and 
            empowerment. Through our unwavering commitment, we strive to break down the barriers that prevent 
            children from realizing their full potential and enable them to build a brighter future.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-[30px] text-primary font-semibold'>What We Do</h1>
        <p className='font-mono text-justify'>
            Through our work, we aspire to make a meaningful and sustainable impact on the lives of 
            children who are unable to continue their education due to financial hardships or personal 
            tragedies. By investing in their education, we believe that we can break the cycle of 
            poverty. empower children to realize their full potential, and create a more equitable and 
            prosperous society. Our mission is to ensure that no child is denied the opportunity to learn 
            and grow. Every year we find out students as such from various localities and help them get 
            admitted into school/college and provide them financial assistance. We reach out to backward 
            areas deprived of educational facilities and help people access primary education and awareness.
